# KVS-Server Logging Challenge

## ðŸ§  Challenge: Logging for `kvs-server`

Production server applications tend to have robust and configurable logging. So
now we're going to add logging to `kvs-server`, and as we continue will look
for useful information to log. During development it is common to use logging
at the `debug!` and `trace!` levels for "println debugging".

On startup log the server's version number. Also log the configuration. For now
that means the IP address and port, and the name of the storage engine.

Good luck!
