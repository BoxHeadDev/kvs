# KvStore Challenge

Welcome to the **KvStore** challenge, inspired by the [PingCap Talent Plan](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan). This is a bite-sized Rust project that introduces you to implementing a simple in-memory key-value store.

## ðŸ“š Overview

You will implement a `KvStore` that supports basic operations like setting, getting, and removing string key/value pairs. The store uses Rust's standard `HashMap` for internal storage and does **not** persist data to disk.

This challenge focuses on:

- Using Rust's standard library (`std::collections::HashMap`)
- Implementing basic data structure methods
- Writing idiomatic Rust code
- Understanding ownership and cloning

## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

By completing this challenge, you will:

- Get hands-on experience with `HashMap`
- Learn how to manage ownership and lifetimes in Rust
- Understand how to structure a simple Rust project

## ðŸ§ª Running the Tests

To check your implementation, run the tests using:

```rust
cargo test
```

Make sure all tests pass!
