# Client RPC Challenge

## ðŸ”Œ Challenge: Implement Full Client-Side RPC for `KvsClient`

Youâ€™ve previously defined the `Request` and `Response` types for the key-value store protocol. Now itâ€™s time to integrate them into the `KvsClient` to implement full client-side remote procedure calls using `serde_json`.

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Task

Update the `KvsClient` to:

- Serialize `Request` enums and send them over the TCP stream.
- Deserialize the appropriate response (`GetResponse`, `SetResponse`, or `RemoveResponse`) from the server.
- Use a `serde_json::Deserializer` with a buffered reader to efficiently parse incoming JSON data.

## ðŸ”§ Notes

- Make sure youâ€™ve included `serde` and `serde_json` in your `Cargo.toml`:
  ```toml
  serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
  serde_json = "1"
  ```
- Youâ€™ll need to handle flushing the writer after each request to ensure the data is sent immediately.
- The deserializer allows you to efficiently stream multiple JSON values from a single connection.

With this complete, your client can now send requests and handle responses in a structured, type-safe way. Power up your KVS!
